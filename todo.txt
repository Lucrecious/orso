Bugs:
    - circular dependencies across module global variables produces wrong and bugged out error message
Roadmap to 0.5v
- enums
- switch expression
    - keep it simple
- remove unless and until, leave only if and while
- Make sure main works properly
    - main function is not properly type checked
    - main is always () -> void. by default programs ends in 0 error code, unless 'exit(n: num)' is used with another code
    - add globals for program arguments
- Make better errors for static analyzer
    - basically, do not output errors that only result from a propogating error (like if a type is invalid don't error just keep going)
    - cover all errors
- type list exposed as a module
- ffi
- cmd with proper commands
- update tests to use a custom assert instead or printing
- single line short hand function body with =>
- syntax highlighter for vscode vim
- compile-time macros
    - @if - compile-time if/else
    - @assert

- write clox in orso

#Roadmap to 1.0v:
- inferred function are first-class citizens at compile-time
- paramterized structs are first-class citizens at compile-time
- parameterized structs can be inferred
- debug compile-time functions and native code
- finalize spec, and make consistent (arguments and params in particular could be unified)
- fuzz testing
- all error tested
- strings
    - string library
- expose ast to language as module
